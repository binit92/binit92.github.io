## :monkey: About Me

The first computer that I have used was also first computer in my village's school, Windows 95 and the first program was a simple batch script using windows commands. A lot of time has passed since then and I am still fascinated by the technology, pace of innovation and domain of possibilities. After working for 8+ years as a senior software engineer on different tech stacks and products, I am taking a pause to **think and learn system design** and how to architect data intensive and compute intensive applications. I believe that a `sense of direction` and deciding `what to work on` are as important if not more as `working hard` and `finding great peers`. Personally, I am an easy going individual who believes in working hard and spreading love, although my friends find me geeky about movies, ideas and things.
