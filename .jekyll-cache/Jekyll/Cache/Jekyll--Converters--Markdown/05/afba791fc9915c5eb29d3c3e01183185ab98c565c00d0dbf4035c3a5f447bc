<p>The first computer that I have used was also first computer in my villageâ€™s school, Windows 95 and the first program was a simple batch script using windows commands. A lot of time has passed since then and I am still fascinated by the technology, pace of innovation and domain of possibilities. After working for 8+ years as a senior software engineer on different tech stacks and products, I am taking a pause to <strong>think and learn system design</strong> and how to architect data intensive and compute intensive applications. I believe that a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sense of direction</code> and deciding <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">what to work on</code> are as important if not more as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">working hard</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">finding great peers</code>. Personally, I am an easy going individual who believes in working hard and spreading love, although my friends find me geeky about movies, ideas and things.</p>
